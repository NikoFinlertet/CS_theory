Budget Proposal Template:
Title: "Cloud Infrastructure Scaling - Budget Request"

Executive Summary:
"We request $150K to scale our cloud infrastructure to support 
300% user growth expected in Q2. This investment will prevent 
service outages and maintain competitive performance."

Current Situation:
"Our current infrastructure operates at 85% capacity, with 
peak loads reaching 95%. Industry best practices recommend 
maintaining 70% capacity for optimal performance and reliability."

Proposed Solution:
"Upgrade to enterprise-tier cloud services with auto-scaling 
capabilities. This includes additional compute resources, 
enhanced database performance, and improved monitoring tools."

Cost Breakdown:
- Compute resources: $80K annually
- Database upgrades: $40K annually
- Monitoring tools: $20K annually
- Implementation: $10K one-time

Expected Benefits:
- Support 500K+ concurrent users
- Reduce response time by 40%
- Prevent estimated $200K revenue loss
- Improve customer satisfaction by 25%

Risk Mitigation:
"Without this investment, we risk service outages during 
peak periods, potential loss of 30% of users, and damage 
to brand reputation."

Implementation Timeline:
- Week 1-2: Procurement and setup
- Week 3-4: Migration and testing
- Week 5-6: Performance optimization
- Week 7-8: Monitoring and validation
