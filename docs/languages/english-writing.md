#### Clarity (–Ø—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å)
```
Clear Writing Principles:
1. Use simple, direct language
2. One main idea per sentence
3. Active voice over passive voice
4. Specific rather than vague terms
5. Logical organization of information

Examples:
‚ùå "The system was designed by our team to be utilized by users"
‚úÖ "Our team designed the system for users"

‚ùå "There are several issues that need to be addressed"
‚úÖ "We need to fix three critical bugs"
```

#### Conciseness (–ö—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–æ—Å—Ç—å)
```
Concise Writing Strategies:
1. Eliminate redundant words
2. Use strong verbs instead of weak verb + noun
3. Remove unnecessary qualifiers
4. Combine related sentences
5. Use bullet points for lists

Examples:
‚ùå "In order to optimize the performance of the system"
‚úÖ "To optimize system performance"

‚ùå "We need to make improvements to the code"
‚úÖ "We need to improve the code"
```

#### Consistency (–ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å)
```
Consistency Guidelines:
1. Use same terminology throughout
2. Maintain consistent formatting
3. Follow style guide religiously
4. Use parallel structure in lists
5. Standardize naming conventions

Examples:
‚ùå "Click Submit button" vs "Press the Send button"
‚úÖ "Click the Submit button" vs "Click the Send button"

‚ùå "user_id, userId, USER_ID" (mixed styles)
‚úÖ "user_id, order_id, session_id" (consistent style)
```

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
```
ADR Template:
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need to choose a database for our new microservices architecture. 
The system will handle user data, transactions, and real-time analytics.

**Decision:**
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

**Rationale:**
1. ACID compliance ensures data consistency
2. Strong JSON support for flexible schema
3. Excellent performance for complex queries
4. Mature ecosystem and tooling
5. Team has extensive PostgreSQL experience

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Data integrity, query flexibility, team expertise
- Negative: Scaling limitations, potential vendor lock-in
- Neutral: Learning curve for advanced features

**Alternatives Considered:**
- MongoDB: Better for document storage but weaker consistency
- MySQL: Good performance but limited JSON support
- Cassandra: Excellent scalability but eventual consistency
```

#### System Design Documents
```
System Design Document Template:
# User Authentication Service

## Overview
This document describes the design of a centralized authentication service 
that will handle user registration, login, and session management across 
all company applications.

## Goals
- Provide secure authentication for all applications
- Support SSO (Single Sign-On) capabilities
- Scale to 1M+ users
- Maintain 99.9% uptime
- Comply with security standards (GDPR, SOC2)

## Non-Goals
- Authorization (handled by individual services)
- User profile management
- Third-party integrations (Phase 2)

## Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Authentication API**: REST API for auth operations
2. **Session Store**: Redis cluster for session management
3. **User Database**: PostgreSQL for user credentials
4. **Token Service**: JWT token generation and validation
5. **Rate Limiter**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Data Flow
1. User submits credentials to Authentication API
2. API validates credentials against User Database
3. On success, generates JWT token via Token Service
4. Session information stored in Session Store
5. JWT token returned to client
6. Client includes token in subsequent requests

## Security Considerations
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens expire after 30 days
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per minute per IP
- HTTPS only for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization

## Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling for API servers
- Redis clustering for session store
- Database read replicas for user lookups
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancer with health checks

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Response time: < 100ms for 95% of requests
- Error rate: < 0.1% for authentication attempts
- Uptime: > 99.9% availability
- Security: Alert on unusual login patterns

## Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Basic authentication (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: SSO integration (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Advanced security features (3 weeks)
- Phase 4: Performance optimization (1 week)
```

Subject: [Action Required] API Performance Issues - Response by EOD

Dear [Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to inform you about performance issues we've identified 
in our user authentication API. The response time has increased 
from 50ms to 300ms over the past week, affecting user experience.

**Current Status:**
- Issue identified: Database query optimization needed
- Impact: 15% of users experiencing slow login
- Priority: High - affects user satisfaction

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Implement query caching (2 days)
2. Add database indexes (1 day)
3. Optimize N+1 queries (1 day)

**Next Steps:**
- I'll begin implementation tomorrow
- Daily progress reports via Slack
- Estimated completion: Friday EOD

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

```
Technical Discussion Example:
üëã Hey team! I'm seeing some performance issues with our API.

**Problem:** 
Response times increased from 50ms to 300ms

**Investigation:**
- Database queries taking 250ms (was 10ms)
- N+1 query problem in user relationships
- Missing index on frequently queried fields

**Solution:**
1. Add composite index on (user_id, created_at)
2. Implement eager loading for user relationships
3. Add query result caching

**Timeline:**
- Index creation: 30 minutes
- Code changes: 2 hours
- Testing: 1 hour

I'll start with the index creation. Any concerns?

üßµ Thread replies:
- "Sounds good! Will this cause any downtime?"
- "No downtime - PostgreSQL supports online index creation"
- "Should we notify the mobile team about potential improvements?"
```

#### Code Review Comments
```
Professional Code Review Language:
Positive Feedback:
"Great job implementing the caching layer! This will significantly improve performance."
"I like how you've structured the error handling - very clean and readable."
"Nice use of TypeScript interfaces here - makes the code much more maintainable."

Constructive Feedback:
"Consider using a more descriptive variable name here for better readability."
"This function is doing multiple things - could we break it into smaller functions?"
"We should add input validation to prevent potential security issues."

Suggestions:
"What do you think about using a switch statement instead of multiple if-else blocks?"
"Could we extract this logic into a utility function for reusability?"
"Have you considered using async/await here for better error handling?"

Questions:
"Could you help me understand the reasoning behind this approach?"
"Are there any edge cases we should consider for this implementation?"
"What's the performance impact of this change?"

#### Incident Report Template
```
Incident Report: API Outage - November 15, 2024

**Executive Summary:**
On November 15, 2024, our user authentication API experienced a 45-minute outage 
affecting 100% of login attempts. The issue was caused by database connection 
pool exhaustion during a traffic spike.

**Timeline:**
- 14:30 UTC: Increased error rates detected
- 14:35 UTC: Alert triggered, team notified
- 14:40 UTC: Investigation began
- 15:00 UTC: Root cause identified
- 15:15 UTC: Mitigation applied
- 15:15 UTC: Service restored

**Impact:**
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Affected users: ~50,000 login attempts
- Revenue impact: $15,000 estimated
- Customer complaints: 23 support tickets

**Root Cause:**
Database connection pool configured for 20 connections, but traffic spike 
required 45+ simultaneous connections. Connection pool exhaustion caused 
all new requests to timeout.

**Resolution:**
- Increased connection pool size from 20 to 50
- Added connection pool monitoring
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern
- Added auto-scaling for database connections

**Prevention:**
- Enhanced monitoring for connection pool usage
- Load testing with 3x expected traffic
- Improved alerting thresholds
- Database connection audit quarterly

**Lessons Learned:**
- Connection pool monitoring was insufficient
- Load testing scenarios were not comprehensive
- Incident response could be faster with better tooling
